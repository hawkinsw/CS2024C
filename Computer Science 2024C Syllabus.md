# Data Structures And Algorithms in Python

## Course Overview/Introduction

This class is about _you_. Okay, not entirely. It's about you _and_ data structures, systems for organizing data and specifying operations on that data. Together we will spend the semester learning how define data structures, analyze their utility in specific situations (i.e., use them to solve problems!) and implement them using Python.

I emphasized that this class is about _you_ and data structures because I want this course to be a chance for you to use data structures (and their implementations in Python) to solve problems that interest you!

The reason that my heart still skips a beat every time that my code "works" is because of the sense of excitement at being able to use and organize data to solve problems.

We are going to have a great semester together!

I am a geek. I love computers. 

I also love reading. I especially love books about the hidden things that make our world work (e.g., _The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger_ and _Enduring Alliance: A History of NATO and the Postwar Global Order_). I like non-fiction more than I like fiction but my favorite writer of all time is David Foster Wallace. My favorite literary series are the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo books. I read the Wall Street Journal in print every day, no matter how much they try to "encourage" me to transition to reading online!

I used to be able to say that I only use two streaming services. In the past few weeks, that has changed. I now subscribe to at least three, but several of those I purchased as gifts for others. So, does that really count? I really only use four personally: Netflix (I have only ever used it to watch Seinfeld); Amazon (I can finally watch the Pink Panther cartoons without loading up a DVD player now that they finished their merger with MGM); Fubo; and MLB.tv! That said, if anyone knows how I can stream Mighty Mouse cartoons, please let me know!

Of course, I love sports, too! My favorite basketball teams are the Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat. My favorite baseball player (current) is Justin Verlander, who just signed a new deal with the San Francisco Giants. My favorite hockey team is the Washington Capitals. My favorite F1 driver is Fernando Alonso and my favorite NASCAR driver was Parker Kligerman -- he just retired, so I will have to find a new person to support.

In high school I was a golfer and a basketball player. In college I got in to running and cycling. I have finished several half marathons, marathons and one half Ironman. I am currently working my way back to marathon shape after a hiatus.

And, crosswords! Lots of crosswords. All the time, crosswords. Occasionally I will do a Connections.

#### Teaching Assistants:

TBD

### Discussion Opportunities
#### Will Hawkins

I am always available for impromptu meetings. Just call me, send email or text message, use a [carrier pigeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homing_pigeon) or [smoke flare](https://www.boatus.org/distress-signals/) and I will be happy to meet! My job is to teach. My sole responsibility at the University is to make sure that you learn everything that you _want_ to learn about programming -- in particular, C++, but I am _always_ willing to talk about anything that is on your mind. Nothing is more important to me than your success in this course!

## Course Format

The course will be taught through a combination of video lessons delivered asynchronously and in-person classes held synchronously (see above). Assessment of your performance will be done through quizzes, assignments, tests and, most of all, labs! You will benefit from using all the resources that are made available -- and if there are resources that I do not provide that you think will be useful, please tell me and I will _gladly_ provide them! As long as you believe that you are using the resources available through this course to their fullest extent, your participation and attendance at any of the in-person classes or the lab sessions is entirely optional. That said, I believe that working interactively with me and your peers will give you the best chance to succeed.

See below for more information on [Class Expectations](#class-expectations) (below) and some "best practices" for participating in class. 

(Almost) Every week there will be a lab. Each lab will have a set of tasks to complete -- a design task, (sometimes) a practice task, a programming task and a critical thinking task. Labs will be due approximately one week after they are assigned. There will be no lab in week 1 of the semester. There will be no lab the week of the midterm. There will be no lab the week of Spring Break. There may be other weeks throughout the semester where there are no lab assignments.

## Course Materials
In this course we will be using several books. In particular, we will be using
1. An online textbook from the interactive publisher _zyBooks_. When you access the first assignment, you will be prompted to authenticate and purchase the book. We will be using their platform for its content _and_ for its interactive practice exercises. Because those exercises will be graded, there is _no way_ to complete this course without purchasing access to the zyBooks platform.
2. O'Reilly Media is one of the original publishers of material for professional computer scientists. In the era when you bought _books_ from Amazon, it was a great day when my order of an O'Reilly book was delivered. Their books were the _best_, and they still are. Of course, they are not cheap ... or are they? Because you are students at UC, you get free access to _all_ of their resources. They have published most (all?) their material on their [Learning Platform](https://learning.oreilly.com/home/). To access that material for free, all you have to do is create an account with your `.edu` email address and, boom, you are in! (**Note**: If you are ever in the need of material to learn a particular topic, I would highly recommend the Learning Platform!)As a supplemental resource for this course, I will pull information from J. Canning, A. Broder, and R. Lafore, Data Structures & Algorithms in Python. Addison-Wesley Professional, 2022. And, you guessed it, the book is available for free on The Learning Platform.
3. There may be other resources that I distribute as PDF files.

Required software: All required software for this course can be freely installed from the Internet. More information about the required software and its use will be provided during the course.

The only item that you must purchase is access to the zyBooks platform.

## Course Outline

| Section | | Topics 
|--------| -- | ------------------|
| 1 | Introduction and Python Refresher | After completing this section, you will be familiar with the goals for the course and will have an understanding of the parts of the Python programming language that we will need to get started building data structures and writing algorithms.
| 2 | Recursion and Algorithmic Analysis | After completing this section, you will understand recursion and how to leverage its power to create elegant solutions to complex problems; and you will understand the foundations of algorithmic analysis and be prepared to analyze the runtime of algorithms that we learn in this course.
| 3 | Object-Oriented Programming and Abstract Data Types | After completing this section, you will be familiar with the basics of object-oriented programming; you will understand the value of designing abstract data types and be able to implement them as classes; and you will be able to implement and analyze stacks and queues.
| 4 | Using Recursion | After completing this section, you will be able to use recursion to write algorithms for sorting lists of objects; and you will be able to use recursion to implement a linked list (one way that _lists_ are implemented in programming languages).
| 5 | Trees | After completing this section, you will be able to use recursion to implement various _trees_ (a flexible data structure that can be tuned to perform certain operations very quickly, but ... Yes, there's _always_ a but).
| 6 | Graphs | After completing this section, you will be able to implement graphs (a data structure that holds elements of information and the connections between them); you will be able to perform operations on graphs; and you will be able to analyze the runtime of the algorithms used to implement those operations.
| 7 | Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms | After completing this section, you will be able to design solutions to problems using _greedy algorithms_ (where "the choice that looks best at the moment ... lead[s] to a globally optimal solution" [1]) and _dynamic programming_ (like recursion, in a dynamic program, solutions to subproblems help you solve the bigger problem; unlike recursion, the subproblems share subproblems [my head hurts!])[1].

## Class Expectations

1. We will give each other the benefit of the doubt.
2. We will assume the best about each other's intentions.
3. We will learn from one another -- I will learn from you and you will learn from me.
4. The classroom will be a place where everyone is welcome -- no exceptions.
5. You will ask questions *when* you have them by raising your hand and interrupting! Every question will be answered; if we cannot find the answer in class, I promise to do research and report the results. 
6. I will not pretend to know everything, because I don't.
7. I will try my best; you will try your best!

## Course Requirements

### Canvas
Please check this course's Canvas page every day. I will use Canvas to distribute updates on the course schedule, links to required readings that are not in the book, announcements about class schedule, etc.

### Reading
Each section will have assigned readings and interactive practice from zyBooks, me, or both!

### Quizzes
There _may_ be a number of quizzes throughout the semester. The quizzes will be distributed on Canvas. You can retake quizzes before the deadline and only your highest score will be kept -- the number of attempts will vary by quiz. On the occasion that there _are_ quizzes, I expect that they will be "low stakes". They will function as a tool for me to gauge whether you are understanding the material and where I have failed to be clear in my explanations. Your quiz grades constitute 10% of your final grade. Late quizzes will not be accepted. Makeups are available if you request accommodations in advance.

### Labs
There will be (mostly) weekly labs throughout the semester. Labs will be due approximately one week after they are assigned. The labs will give us a chance to work together on applying the skills that we have learned in the classroom. Lab submissions will be done either through Gradescope or through a Jupyter Notebook (or maybe both!). Both of these tools are designed to give you immediate feedback on whether or not the solution that you have designed meets all the requirements. In other words, when you submit your labs you will have confidence that you have earned 75% of the points on the assignment (that percentage _may_ vary). Your lab grades will constitute 40% of your final grade. For each day that you are late submitting a lab, you will lose 10%.  

### Reading Assignments
Paired with the readings for each section, there will be interactive assignments from the textbook. You will access those assignments through zyBooks which will be linked through the _Assignments_ link on on the Canvas page for this course. The assignments will be worth 25% of your final grade. For each day that you are late submitting an assignment, you will lose 10%. 

Because you will complete the reading assignments through the book's online software, you _must_ purchase the book. See above for information on how to purchase access to zyBooks.

If you are on a scholarship that covers the cost of your books, please see me. I will coordinate with the UC bookstore so that you can purchase access from them.

### Participation
As college students, you are adults and free to make for yourself the decision about whether or not to attend class. However, I *highly* recommend attending all lectures and all labs.

You will get the most out of this course if you,
1. attend class regularly;
1. work through labs early so that you get clarification and help without the stress of a looming deadline;
1. participate in class and lab by asking questions and working with your peers; and
1. maintain a professional, collegial attitude at all times.

### Tests
There will be two tests in this course: one at (roughly) the halfway point and one at the end of the semester. Together, the two tests are worth 20% of your grade. The format of the tests will be determined as their dates approach. The midterm will be given during the week of **March 10th, 2025**. The final will be given **during Finals Week (April 21st - April 25th)**

## Final Grades
Your final grade for the course will be calculated according to the percentages above (and recapped below). There will be no +s or -s assigned in this course. Letter grades will be assigned according to the following limits:

| Letter Grade | Percentage Range |
|------------- | -----------------|
| A | 100 - 90|
| B | 89 - 80 |
| C | 79 - 70 |
| D | 69 - 60 |
| F | Below 60|

As a recap, the assignment types are weighted according to the following percentages when calculating final grades:

| Category | Weight |
| --- | --- |
| Reading Assignments | 25% |
| Quizzes | 15% |
| Tests | 20% |
| Labs | 40% |
| Total | 100% |

## Logistics
### Your Success
Your success in this course is my highest priority. I will present the material the best way that I can but I realize that not everyone learns the same way. If you are having trouble with anything in this course, please contact me using the means given above.

Further, I understand that there are reasons why materials I present and distribute may be inaccessible for certain people. I have tried as hard as possible to make each presentation, document, handout, etc. as accessible as possible but if there is anything I can do to help you use the materials, please let me know. 

As a professor at UC I am part of a group of people who are committed to creating and fostering a positive learning and working environment based on open communication, mutual respect, and inclusion. If there are aspects of the design, instruction, and/or experiences within this course that result in barriers to your inclusion, participation, or the accurate assessment of your achievement, please feel free to contact me. 
 
### Class Cancellation
In the event that I have to cancel class, I will post an announcement to the course page on Canvas. 

### Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Every person who enters this classroom should feel comfortable being their authentic self. Any behavior that threatens that will not be tolerated.

I am committed to the fundamental principles of academic freedom and human dignity. Diversity in all forms is something I welcome, foster, and prize. I believe that honest attempts to understand the perspectives of others facilitates learning, and as a class we will strive to achieve this goal at all times. I strongly disavow discrimination -- including harassment -- on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, religion, sex or gender identity, disability, age, sexual orientation, or veteran status. I expect that each of us will hold one another accountable for maintaining these ideals.

We are free to be our authentic selves and do our best learning when we are properly caffeinated. If you are the first person to read this sentence and send me an email, you will receive a Starbucks giftcard. Yes, for real.

### Religious Accommodations

This course will follow the official policy recommended by the University and the State:

>Ohio law and the University's Student Religious Accommodations for Courses Policy 1.3.7 permits a student, upon request, to be absent for reasons of faith or religious or spiritual belief system or participate in organized activities conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or other religious or spiritual organization and/or to receive alternative accommodations with regard to examinations and other course requirements due to an absence permitted for the above-described reasons. Not later than fourteen days after the first day of instruction in the course, a student should provide the instructor with written notice of the specific dates for which the student requests alternative accommodations. For additional information about this policy, please contact the Executive Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access at (513) 556-5503 or [oeohelp@UCMAIL.UC.EDU](oeohelp@UCMAIL.UC.EDU).

That said, I am _more_ than willing to make any accommodation necessary to guarantee that you are able to celebrate all the religious and cultural holidays that are important to you. All I ask is that you be proactive when requesting any accommodations.

### Personal Care
College is stressful and stress is harmful. In addition, we are learning in the aftermath of a global pandemic. 

**Your health is a priority.** 

If you feel sick, please stay home. If you feel overwhelmed, contact a care provider. If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know. UC's [Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/caps.html) is a fantastic group of people who are ready to help you in whatever way you need. In addition, College of Engineering and Applied Science has an embedded counselor named [Amy Blankenship](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/caps/staff/amy-blankenship--lpcc-s--trcc--she-her-.html). She is an incredible resource and I highly encourage you to use what she can offer. 

While you are sick, if you are able, please contact me and let me know. However, if you are not able to contact me, *do not worry*. Contact me when you are safe and healthy and we will work out alternate arrangements for anything that you might have missed. There is nothing about this course that we cannot rearrange to accommodate your health and well being.  

### Academic Integrity
Your work is your work. Learning to collaborate ethically and honestly is an important part of being a professional. You will be expected to collaborate effectively with your colleagues as a professional. In this course you will have opportunities to work alone and work together. In the description of each quiz, assignment and test you will be given explicit instructions on the collaboration policy. If you have any doubt about what constitutes appropriate collaboration, please contact me immediately. I will gladly answer any questions that you have! You may also want to read the University's [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/conduct/student-code-of-conduct.html).

You are free to, and sometimes will be required to, reference outside materials in order to complete certain assignments. Using outside material is encouraged in this course! Any materials that you use, however, must be appropriately cited. For citing material that you used to help you write code, appropriate citation must be done in comments. For written assignments, appropriate citation must be done using IEEE, ACM, APA, Chicago or MLA academic citation format. If you need help learning how to cite resources in written work, I would be glad to help! If you prefer, the professionals in the [Academic Writing Center](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/learning-commons/programs/writing-center.html) can help you, too. The Libraries also have an incredibly helpful [resource](https://guides.libraries.uc.edu/integrity/home) detailing how to properly attribute another person's work when you used something that they produced. Again, citing another person's work, collaborating with peers and even publishing your work are all part of being a professional member of the club of computer scientists. However, you must do it within the prescribed guidelines and give credit where it is due.

Penalties for violating academic integrity will be severe and may, depending on the nature of the transgression, lead to failure in the course. I don't want to deal with cheating and you don't want to deal with it either.

**TL;DR**: There is no reason for you to cheat in this course -- if you are struggling with an assignment, test, lab (anything!), just ask for help! It's even easier than cheating and you'll learn something!

#### Generative AI
Generative "artificial intelligence" (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) is considered an "outside resource" for the purposes of this class. If you use generative AI in this course _for any reason_, you must make proper citations. Failure to make proper citation for use of generative AI constitutes a violation of academic integrity and the penalties outlined above will apply. If you have questions, please ask.

Though you may find it expedient to rely on generative AI to complete assignments during the course, please consider whether or not using it will help you achieve your educational goals. I am not nearly as succinct or solicitous as Gemini or ChatGPT but I believe that I do offer value. As I said before, I am here to help you learn -- generative AI is not.

Finally, in order to determine whether you have relied on generative AI without proper citation, I reserve the right to question you about the contents of any assignment. In particular, I reserve the right to ask you to 

1. explain the rationale for writing your code the way you did, or
2. elaborate on ideas/opinions/statements expressed/made in your critical thinking assignments.

I have no doubt that generative AI will make us more productive as computer scientists, but I think it is important to be honest about the difference between our work and its work.

### Student Resources
The University has a tremendous array of support options for you! If you are comfortable, I will gladly help you find the proper resource. If you are not comfortable talking to me, please visit Student Affairs [online](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/student-affairs.html) or in person (Steger Student Life Center, Suite 630). 

UC's [Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/caps.html) is a fantastic group of people who are ready to help you in whatever way you need. In addition, College of Engineering and Applied Science has an embedded counselor named [Amy Blankenship](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/caps/staff/amy-blankenship--lpcc-s--trcc--she-her-.html). She is an incredible resource and I highly encourage you to use what she can offer. 

In case of an emergency, Student Affairs offers a 24-Hour Consultation Crisis Helpline at 513-556-0648. 

Help is available. \
Call 988. \
There is **hope**. The Lifeline **works**. You are not alone in crisis.

### Disability and Accessibility

Students with disabilities have the right to full and equal access at the University of Cincinnati. The [Accessibility Resources (AR)](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/accessibility-resources.html) office on campus will work with you and me to identify reasonable accommodations to ensure an equitable opportunity to meet all requirements for this course. AR is also a resource for coordinating access and accommodation to all non-academic programs and opportunities available to UC students and potential students.

If you are in need of accommodation, please contact the AR as soon as possible. I will work with them and with you to provide an inclusive and equitable environment for you to learn.

# Current State
This syllabus is current as of 1/15/2025. It is, however, a _living document_ and I reserve the right to change it at any time. All changes to the syllabus will be announced on Canvas.
